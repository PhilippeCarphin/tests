#+TITLE: Reading from STDIN: Only using Cat does it right

[[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/716439/161630][This Unix Stack Exchange post]] explains why, despite my annoyance at the fact
that BASH can't do it directly, we have to use =cat= to read STDIN into a variable.

The file =read.sh= reads stdin using =cat= or =read= and outputs to a file.

This script tests out a "pure bash" way to read stdin without using =cat= by
doing =read= in a =while= loop.  The =run.sh= script tries both methods and
diffs the results.

Reading STDIN should be done with =cat=.  Doing it with =read= is only to check
if it's possible to get the same result as =cat= but I mainly did it because I'm
salty that the proper way in =BASH= to read =STDIN= is to use =cat.

Anyway, the post is convincing that using =cat= is acceptable because it's the
only way to get it right.
