* Introduction

The idea is to figure out how to correctly create a package config file
=FooConfig.cmake= for the upstream package so that the downstream package can
use it.

While =FooConfig.cmake= is the upstream package and is the focus of this
test, it likely depends on some other packages (in this case =upstream_dep=)
which slightly complicates the writing of its config file but makes this test
more representative of real situations.
