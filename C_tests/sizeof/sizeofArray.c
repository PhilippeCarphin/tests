/* This is because I started using cppcheck, which is supposed to work for C and
 * C++.  It warns me that passing an array as a function argument to sizeof
 * would return the size of a pointer.
 *
 * Also, see the test in array_diff_pointer where it is explained that when an
 * array is passed to a function, the array identifier is converted to a
 * pointer.  That test shows that it makes a difference.
 *
 * NVM I get it, it's when I pass the array to a function, and you do sizeof
 * that it gives the size of a pointer.  The reason is that sizeof is acutally
 * resolved at compile time.  When the array declaration is in the scope of the
 * "call" to sizeof, then the compiler can know what size the array has but when
 * it's not, then too bad.
 *
 * This is true even when the array size is given in the function delcaration.
 * As I have tested, the compiler doesn't seem to give a shit about the size of
 * the array being passed so the array size given in the function declaration is
 * just a waste of characters, and you might as well just use 'char *' so that
 * you don't fool yourself into thingking that 'char param[]' makes any
 * difference.
 *
 * Another thing to check out is old-school C function definitions, and these
 * don't work either.
 *
 * Another thing I want to check out is variable sized arrays. The test with
 * various calls to var_sized_array(size_t array_size) show that we do in fact
 * get the array size.  It also shows that there is more than compile time
 * substitution going on.  Even if we suspect that the compiler can figure out
 * the size from the call var_sized_array(1234) at compile time because of the
 * integer litteral constant, the following calls using a user-entered char
 * prove that sizeof is resolved at runtime.
