#+TITLE: Using Python in your C program

* Intro

We have something that is implemented in Python and we want to use it in
another C project of ours.

** The Python code

The python code is =philmodule.py= which is a module that has a global
dictionary and two functions that set and get values.

** The C code

The C code is what we would add to an existing C program:
- Initialize Python at program start with =Py_Initialize()=
- Finalize Python at program end with =Py_Finalize()=
- Some code to import the module and store a reference to it somewhere
- Some wrapper functions to convert between C values and Python objects.
