This is the [Basic Logging Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.8/howto/logging.html#basic-logging-tutorial)

My main takeaways are
- Logging configuration should be done at the application level and not at the
  library level.
- Logging configuration is demonstrated
- Libraries should just make logging calls and let users who make applications
  do the configuration.
